## **Background**

This project was inspired by the announcement that the FDA released a batch of **89 Complete Response Letters (CRLs)** issued in response to new drug and biologic applications that did not receive approval. The CRLs released pertain to actions taken by the Agency between **January 12, 2024** and **August 18, 2025**.

The announcement was made on **September 4, 2025** on the following website, which includes a link to the letters:  
ðŸ”— [FDA Announcement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-announces-real-time-release-complete-response-letters-posts-previously-unpublished)

This repository was created to encourage review of the 89 letters. An EXCEL (.xlsx) spreadsheet that captures metadata is provided. R code for visualizations is provided in a file that includes images of the plots. This repository also includes informal write ups of the visualizations, as posted on LinkedIn.

Everything shared and discussed here is based only on **publicly-available information**. If the information wasnâ€™t directly available in a letter, it was obtained from an Internet search.
