Background
This project was inspired by the announcement that the FDA released a batch of 89 Complete Response Letters (CRLs) issued in response to new drug and biologic applications that did not receive regulatory approval.
The CRLs released pertain to actions taken by the Agency between January 12, 2024 and August 18, 2025.
The announcement was made on September 4, 2025 on the following website, which includes a link to the letters:
https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-announces-real-time-release-complete-response-letters-posts-previously-unpublished-batch-89

This repository was created to encourage review of the 89 letters.
An EXCEL (.xlsx) spreadsheet that captures metadata is provided.
R code for visualizations is provided in a file that includes images of the plots.
This repository also includes informal write ups of the visualizations, as posted on LinkedIn.

Everything shared and discussed here is based only on publicly-available information.
If the information wasn’t explicitly stated in one of the 89 letters, it was obtained from an Internet search.
